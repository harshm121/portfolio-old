## Hello! 

Hi, I am a final year undergraduate student studying at Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi.
I am interested in Machine Learning (both theory and its application) and strongly believe that technology benefits human society. I believe that there are much more important things we can solve using machine learning rather than increasing clicks on advertisements.

Check out the projects I have done [here](http://harshm121.github.io/Projects). I did my internship at [Videoken](https://videoken.com). They are pretty amazing people determined to change the way we watch videos, you should check out there work.

In my free time I mostly surf Youtube, there are some interesting (and nerdy) channels which produce awesome content. I also like watching (and reading) biographies and documentaries. I am a huge Google fan and admire the philosophies they have as a company and also I hate facebook as I believe behind their 'on paper' motive to "connect people" they have some shitty morals and are ruining lives slowly and steadily.

These are some very strong opinions but I am always up for discussing on these topics. I can spend hours debating and/or discussing philosophy, technology and both (:P)
