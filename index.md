I am a Data Scientist at [Flipkart](https://www.flipkart.com/) in the Recommendations team supervised by [Dr. Aditya Rachakonda](https://in.linkedin.com/in/adityarachakonda), [Dr. Arnab Bhattacharya](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arnab-bhattacharya-26383573) and previously by [Samik Datta](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samik-datta-7b2a927a/). I work on various Candidate Generation and Ranking problems. Prior to joining Flipkart, I completed my undergrad at IIT Delhi advised by [Dr. Prathosh AP](https://sites.google.com/view/prathosh). 


Since March 2020, I have also been volunteering my time with [DSIndiaVsCovid](http://dsindiavscovid.org/). There, I work on COVID-19 case count forecasting using SEIR type compartmental epidemiological models and bayesian optimization to estimate parameters of the model. The framework is used to guide public health authorities of various Indian districts to plan for the upcoming burden on healthcare infrastructure. I also worked on a control framework to guide public health agencies in creating a policy schedule to control an epidemic.


Broadly my interest lies in Computer Vision, understanding Deep Learning and Machine Learning (theory as well as it's 'impactful' application). I strongly believe that technology benefits human society and has a lot of potential to improve human lives.

<i>Shaping an epidemic with an adaptive contact restriction policy that balances the disease and socioeconomic impact has been the holy grail during the COVID-19 pandemic. Most of the existing work on epidemiological models focuses on scenario-based forecasting via simulation but techniques for explicit control of epidemics via an analytical framework are largely missing. In this paper, we consider the problem of determining the optimal policy for transmission control assuming SIR dynamics, which is the most widely used epidemiological paradigm. We first demonstrate that the SIR model with infectious patients and susceptible contacts (i.e., product of transmission rate and susceptible population) interpreted as predators and prey respectively reduces to a Lotka-Volterra (LV) predator-prey model. The modified SIR system (LVSIR) has a stable equilibrium point, an energy conservation property, and exhibits bounded cyclic behaviour similar to an LV system. This mapping permits a theoretical analysis of the control problem supporting some of the recent simulation-based studies that point to the benefits of periodic interventions. We use a control-Lyapunov approach to design adaptive control policies (CoSIR) to nudge the SIR model to the desired equilibrium that permits ready extensions to richer compartmental models. We also describe a practical implementation of this transmission control method by approximating the ideal control with a finite, but a time-varying set of restriction levels and provide simulation results to demonstrate its efficacy.

<i>Accurate forecasts of infections for localized regions are valuable for policy making and medical capacity planning. Existing compartmental and agent-based models for epidemiological forecasting employ static parameter choices and cannot be readily contextualized, while adaptive solutions focus primarily on the reproduction number. In the current work, we propose a novel model-agnostic Bayesian optimization approach for learning model parameters from observed data that generalizes to multiple application-specific fidelity criteria. Empirical results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach with SEIR-like compartmental models on COVID-19 case forecasting tasks. A city-level forecasting system based on this approach is being used for COVID-19 response in a few highly impacted Indian cities.</i>

**Personal Interests:** I like watching and reading biographies and documentaries. I also enjoy surfing YouTube which I feel is an extremely far reaching and impactful platform. I have personally found alot of content which intrigues me. Philosophy and Technology are two domains I find very engaging and am always up for discussing them at lengths.
