*Problem Statement:* Creating an audience of users with high probability of conversion for a store for precision merchandising on Flipkart Grocery platform called Supermart


*Work Description:* Designed and performed large scale experiments on temporal point process based precision merchandising algorithm for Flipkart Grocery. 
Using Mixture of Weibull function to model periodicity in consumable purchasing (sugar every month) and cross excitation of stores (purchase in bread excites purchase in butter)
I worked on large scale experiment design and evaluating the proposed method against state-of-the-art methods.
