3. In the last semester of my undergraduation, I was fortunate to take a course on Statistical Learning Theory by [Prof Sumeet Agarwal](http://web.iitd.ac.in/~sumeet/). As a part of the course, I wrote a term paper on to talk about the Philosophical Motivations of VC Dimension, more specifically, the work of Sir Karl Popper and how it relates to VC Dimension. [This](/PDFs/Learning_Theory.pdf) is the term paper and [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1x7bUChOBlgLV3jYDB-SVYzmxDStZtNmn4EXri9mgwIo/edit?usp=sharing) is a presentation on the same topic.
