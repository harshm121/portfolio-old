### Articles



1. A medium article explaining one of the papers which received ICLR'17 Best Paper Award : [Paper explained: “UNDERSTANDING DEEP LEARNING REQUIRES RETHINKING GENERALIZATION” — ICLR’17](https://harshm121.medium.com/paper-explained-understanding-deep-learning-requires-rethinking-generalization-iclr17-939a89096ab7)

2. My thoughts on how Social Media is affecting politics: [Social Media — An Echo Chamber for politics](https://harshm121.medium.com/social-media-an-echo-chamber-for-politics-a753763d9a9c)

### Sampled Course work

1. In the last semester of my undergraduation, I was fortunate to take a course on [Learning Theory](http://web.iitd.ac.in/~sumeet/ell880.html) by [Prof. Sumeet Agarwal](http://web.iitd.ac.in/~sumeet/). As a part of the course, I wrote a term paper on to talk about the Philosophical Motivations of VC Dimension, more specifically, the work of Sir Karl Popper and how it relates to VC Dimension. [This](/PDFs/Learning_Theory.pdf) is the term paper and [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1x7bUChOBlgLV3jYDB-SVYzmxDStZtNmn4EXri9mgwIo/edit?usp=sharing) is a presentation on the same topic.  

2. Again, in the last semester of my undergraudation (yes, I did a lot of interesting courses in my last semester), I was lucky to do another very interesting course on [Mind, Machines and Language](http://web.iitd.ac.in/~sumeet/ell457.html). In one of the assignments, we were asked to write our views on one of [Robert Epstein's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Epstein) [article](https://aeon.co/essays/your-brain-does-not-process-information-and-it-is-not-a-computer) on Computational Theory of Mind. [Here](/PDFs/Response_The_empty_brain.pdf) are my views on the article. 

3. In one of the assignments of Advanced Machine Learning course by [Prof. Prathosh AP](https://sites.google.com/view/prathosh/home?authuser=0), the task was to classify videos based on their speakers. We (a group of 3 students) solved the task and performed a number of visualisations to understand what is happening under the hood of deep models for classification. [Here](/PDFs/ELL888_Assignment2.pdf) is a technical report of our work.
