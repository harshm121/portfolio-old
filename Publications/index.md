<i>Consumable categories, such as grocery and fast-moving consumer goods, are quintessential to the growth of e-commerce marketplaces in developing countries. In this work, we present the design and implementation of a precision merchandising system, which creates audience sets from over 10 million consumers and is deployed at Flipkart Supermart, one of the largest online grocery stores in India. We employ temporal point process to model the latent periodicity and mutual-excitation in the purchase dynamics of consumables. Further, we develop a likelihood-free estimation procedure that is robust against data sparsity, censure and noise typical of a growing marketplace. Lastly, we scale the inference by quantizing the triggering kernels and exploiting sparse matrix-vector multiplication primitive available on a commercial distributed linear algebra backend. In operation spanning more than a year, we have witnessed a consistent increase in click-through rate in the range of 25-70% for banner-based merchandising in the storefront, and in the range of 12-26% for push notification-based campaigns.

<i>Shaping an epidemic with an adaptive contact restriction policy that balances the disease and socioeconomic impact has been the holy grail during the COVID-19 pandemic. Most of the existing work on epidemiological models focuses on scenario-based forecasting via simulation but techniques for explicit control of epidemics via an analytical framework are largely missing. In this paper, we consider the problem of determining the optimal policy for transmission control assuming SIR dynamics, which is the most widely used epidemiological paradigm. We first demonstrate that the SIR model with infectious patients and susceptible contacts (i.e., product of transmission rate and susceptible population) interpreted as predators and prey respectively reduces to a Lotka-Volterra (LV) predator-prey model. The modified SIR system (LVSIR) has a stable equilibrium point, an energy conservation property, and exhibits bounded cyclic behaviour similar to an LV system. This mapping permits a theoretical analysis of the control problem supporting some of the recent simulation-based studies that point to the benefits of periodic interventions. We use a control-Lyapunov approach to design adaptive control policies (CoSIR) to nudge the SIR model to the desired equilibrium that permits ready extensions to richer compartmental models. We also describe a practical implementation of this transmission control method by approximating the ideal control with a finite, but a time-varying set of restriction levels and provide simulation results to demonstrate its efficacy.

<i>Accurate forecasts of infections for localized regions are valuable for policy making and medical capacity planning. Existing compartmental and agent-based models for epidemiological forecasting employ static parameter choices and cannot be readily contextualized, while adaptive solutions focus primarily on the reproduction number. In the current work, we propose a novel model-agnostic Bayesian optimization approach for learning model parameters from observed data that generalizes to multiple application-specific fidelity criteria. Empirical results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach with SEIR-like compartmental models on COVID-19 case forecasting tasks. A city-level forecasting system based on this approach is being used for COVID-19 response in a few highly impacted Indian cities.</i>
