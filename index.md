I am a Data Scientist at Flipkart. I work with the Recommenations team supervised by [Dr. Aditya Rachakonda](https://in.linkedin.com/in/adityarachakonda), [Dr. Arnab Bhattacharya](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arnab-bhattacharya-26383573) and previously by [Samik Datta](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samik-datta-7b2a927a/), where I work on various Candidate Generation and Ranking problems. Prior to joining Flipkart, I completed my undergrad at IIT Delhi advised by [Dr. Prathosh AP](https://sites.google.com/view/prathosh). 


Since March 2020, I have also been volunteering my time with [DSIndiaVsCovid](http://dsindiavscovid.org/). We are working on COVID-19 case count forecasting for heavily impacted cities using SEIR type compartmental epidemiological models and bayesian optimization to estimate parameters of the model. The framework was used to guide public health authorities of various Indian districts to plan for the upcoming burden on healthcare infrastructure. We are also working on a control framework to guide public health agencies in creating a policy schedule to control an epidemic. 



Broadly my interest lies in Machine Learning (both theory and its application) and Computer Vision. I strongly believe that technology benefits human society and has a lot of potential to improve human lives.

Accurate forecasts of infections for localized regions are valuable for policy making and medical capacity planning. Existing compartmental and agent-based models for epidemiological forecasting employ static parameter choices and cannot be readily contextualized, while adaptive solutions focus primarily on the reproduction number. In the current work, we propose a novel model-agnostic Bayesian optimization approach for learning model parameters from observed data that generalizes to multiple application-specific fidelity criteria. Empirical results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach with SEIR-like compartmental models on COVID-19 case forecasting tasks. A city-level forecasting system based on this approach is being used for COVID-19 response in a few highly impacted Indian cities.

**Personal Interests**: In my free time I mostly surf Youtube, there are some interesting channels which produce awesome content. I also like watching (and reading) biographies and documentaries. I can spend hours debating and/or discussing philosophy, technology
